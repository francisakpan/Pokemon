#Pokemon app

Implementation 1 : 
A simple application that queries the  https://pokeapi.co/ api to shows a list of all the pokemon 
characters and their pictures.  

When a pokemon character is clicked it lead to a page with full details of the character pulled 
from the appropriate endpoint with all images, move, abilities, stats etc showing at different sections.
